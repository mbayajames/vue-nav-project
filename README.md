Troubleshooting

Compilation Errors:
Ensure all CSS blocks are closed (e.g., @media in components).
Run npm install again if dependencies are missing.
Check console logs for specific errors.


Images Not Loading:
Verify Unsplash URLs in components (e.g., GalleryPage.vue images).
Clear browser cache or test in incognito mode.
Example: Middle gallery image was replaced with https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1541345023926-55d6e0853f4b?auto=format&fit=crop&w=600.


Icons Missing:
Confirm @fortawesome/fontawesome-free is installed and imported in main.js.
Check for 404 errors on all.min.css.


Animations Not Working:
Ensure vue3-aos is initialized in main.js.
Verify data-aos attributes in templates.


Mobile Layout Issues:
Test at 768px and 480px breakpoints.
Check clamp and @media rules in style.css and components.
